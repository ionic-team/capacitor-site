        Capacitor collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage. This is
        an opt-in program that provides insight to the Capacitor team to help
        improve the product. By opting in, you will be able to provide valuable
        insights that could shape the future of the product.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You will be asked after the Capacitor CLI successfully finishes its
        first command if you would like to enter the program. If you opt out,
        telemetry data will not be collected and you will not be asked again.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={3}>Why?</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Anonymous usage data allows the team to gain insight into how Capacitor
        is being used. With this information, we can better prioritize fixes and
        features. It also provides the team with a better understanding of the
        developer experience.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={3}> What is Collected?</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Usage data is entirely anonymous and will only include the following:

        <li>Command name, arguments, and selected flags</li>
        <li>Command duration</li>
        <li>Error message (if the command failed, no stacktrace included)</li>
        <li>Capacitor machine ID (anonymous, generated ID)</li>
        <li>Project ID (anonymous, generated ID)</li>
        <li>Your operating system (Mac, Linux, Windows)</li>
        <li>
          Versions of: NodeJS, Capacitor CLI, core, platforms, and official

      <Heading level={3}>How to opt in or out</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        You may opt out at any time from the program by running{' '}

      </Paragraph>
      <code-snippet
        language="shell-session"
        code={`
        npx cap telemetry off
        `}
