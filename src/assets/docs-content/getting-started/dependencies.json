Or you can use <a href=\"http://ionicframework.com/appflow\">Ionic Appflow</a> to build for iOS even if you&#39;re on Windows.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you&#39;ll need to install <strong><a href=\"https://cocoapods.org/\">CocoaPods</a></strong> (<code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>), and install the <strong>Xcode Command Line tools</strong> (either from Xcode, or running <code>xcode-select --install</code>).</p>\n<p>As a rule, the latest version of Capacitor always supports at least the last two iOS versions.</p>\n<p>Capacitor 2.0 supports iOS 11+.</p>\n<p>Capacitor uses the WKWebView.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"android-development\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#android-development\"><ion-icon name=\"link\"></ion-icon>\n  Android Development\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>Android development requires the <strong>Android SDK</strong> installed with <strong><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html\">Android Studio</a></strong>. Technically, Android Studio isn&#39;t required as you can build and run apps using only the Android CLI tools, but it will make building and running your app much easier so we strongly recommend using it.</p>\n<p>Android version support for Capacitor is more complex than iOS. Currently, we are targeting API level 21 or greater, meaning Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or above. This represents over 90% of the Android market.</p>\n<p>Also, Capacitor requires an Android WebView with Chrome version 50 or later. On Android 5 and 6, the Capacitor uses the System WebView. On Android 7+, Google Chrome is used.</p>\n"}
