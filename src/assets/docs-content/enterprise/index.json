Identity Vault goes above and beyond a typical fingerprint or face scanning plugin to work with secure enclaves and encryption services on each platform. This is necessary because simply scanning a fingerprint or face identity, as most community plugins do, does not provide adequate security and protection from jailbreaking or other exploits. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/enterprise/identity-vault\">Identity Vault</a> may also be used standalone and integrated with any existing authentication flow to provide advanced session security.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"offline-and-encrypted-data-storage\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#offline-and-encrypted-data-storage\"><ion-icon name=\"link\"></ion-icon>\n  Offline and Encrypted Data Storage\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/enterprise/offline-storage\">Offline Storage</a>, Capacitor developers have access to a high-performance, encrypted SQL data storage system for building powerful and secure offline-enabled apps on iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Combined with <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/enterprise/identity-vault\">Identity Vault</a>, developers can securely manage data encryption keys and implement on-device data management best practices without touching a line of native code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"enterprise-support-and-advisory\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#enterprise-support-and-advisory\"><ion-icon name=\"link\"></ion-icon>\n  Enterprise Support and Advisory\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>For teams building mission-critical apps, Ionic provides enterprise-grade support and optional advisory services to help make your next major app project a success. Customers remark how much they love being able to add a team of mobile experts to their project by working with Ionic.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-in-touch\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#get-in-touch\"><ion-icon name=\"link\"></ion-icon>\n  Get in touch\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>Interested?
