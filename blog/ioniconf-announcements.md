Today at the first ever official Ioniconf, we unveiled a number of exciting updates to Capacitor and the Capacitor community.

In no particular order, we announced:

* Capacitor will be opening up to embrace every modern web app technology and ecosystem. That means expect to see a lot more Capacitor apps running Angular Material, Tailwind, Material UI, and even Bootstrap.
* [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) to curate the best community-supported Capacitor plugins and encourage more developers to build plugins.
* Capacitor Elements, an upcoming project to bring operating-system level UI experiences to every Capacitor app, regardless of the web framework or UI library an app uses (powered by Ionic Framework under the hood).
* We've updated the Capacitor site, moved to a new domain ([https://capacitorjs.com/](capacitorjs.com)) and a new Twitter handle ([https://twitter.com/capacitorjs](@capacitorjs)).

Capacitor is quickly becoming the focal point of Ionic's open source offering, and we're investing heavily in it. Stay tuned for a ton more Capacitor updates in the coming months!
