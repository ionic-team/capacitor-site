# Capacitor Community Plugins

The community has built a number of Capacitor plugins to add functionality to your app.

There are a number of ways to find community plugins: Search the web or npm to find any published plugins,
or explore the official [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) GitHub org and [NPM scope](https://npmjs.com/~capacitor-community) for a curated list of quality, community supported Capacitor plugins.

## Capacitor Community

The official [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community) GitHub org and [NPM scope](https://npmjs.com/~capacitor-community) is a new effort to curate the best Capacitor community-supported plugins and provide consistent project and code conventions. The Capacitor core team facilitates work but does not officially maintain any plugins in this org.
