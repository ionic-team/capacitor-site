# Using Capacitor Plugins

<p class="intro">Capacitor ships with a number of built-in plugins, known as Capacitor APIs, such as <a href="https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/camera">Camera</a> and <a href="https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/filesystem">Filesystem</a>.</p>

<p class="intro">However, chances are your app will need to access more native functionality than provided out of the box in Capacitor.</p>

<p class="intro">Fortunately, you can quickly add your own native functionality by writing a small amount of native code then exposing it as a Capacitor plugin by following the <a href="/docs/plugins">Plugin Guide</a>.</p>

## Finding Plugins

The community has built a number of plugins for various native functionality and you can easily add them to your app.

See our [Community Plugins](/docs/community/plugins/) list for some options.

## Using Cordova and Ionic Native Plugins

Capacitor also supports a wide range of [Cordova plugins](/docs/cordova/using-cordova-plugins), so there are a lot to choose from.
